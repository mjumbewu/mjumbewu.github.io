        <p>I use technology as a tool to help build the capacity of individuals and communities to shape their cities, their neighborhoods, and their own lives.  This perspective of technology as a means for social empowerment guides my professional and "extracurricular" development.</p>

        <p>I primarily work in Web stacks with Python and/or JavaScript at the core. I have experience in several other languages, and am committed to using the best tools in context.</p>

            <h3>Digital Services Architect at The City of Philadelphiia</h3>
            <p>2015 - 2017</p>
          </header>

          <p>Within the Office of Innovation and Technology and, later, the Open Data and Digital Transformation (ODDT) group, I researched, designed, and developed processes and tools to help City departments collect, use, and release data. Among other things, my projects included:</p>

          <p>I developed an <a href="https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/simplehmis">interim Homeless Management Information System</a> for the Office of Supportive Housing to help them avoid regressing to a paper-based data collection system, which would have jeopardized their ability to deliver HUD reports required for a significant portion of their funding. The implementation was part of an experiment to see whether Django’s Admin application would be a good platform for quickly building custom data-entry tools for departments.</p>

          <p>I implemented an interactive <a href="http://cityofphiladelphia.github.io/bullet-voting/democratic">data visualization of occurrences of  &ldquo;bullet voting&rdquo;</a> -- when voters choose only one of 5 allowed candidates for At-large Council positions -- during the 2015 City Council primary election. The visualization allowed the City Controller’s office to communicate a confusing phenomenon to the general public. The implementation used Carto’s extensions on top of Leaflet for mapping, and C3 for charting. The project was completed on a tight timeline of approximately two weeks.</p>

          <p>I researched and began designing processes to centralize deployment, management, and reporting around the City’s ETL pipelines. Based on the challenges that we faced in ODDT around ETL, I identified and began implementing an instance of Airflow. I also began documenting recommendations on how we should be building ETL scripts, using petl as a data transformation and validation library.</p>

            <h3>Software Developer at OpenPlans</h3>
            <p>2012 - 2015</p>
          </header>

          <p>I worked on a small team with amazing people on projects that empower people to get involved in planning for the future of their communities and cities. Among other projects, we worked on the following:</p>

          <p>Starting in 2012, we developed <a href="http://openplans.org/shareabouts/">Shareabouts</a>, a flexible tool for gathering geography-specific public input. I was primarily responsible for developing the Django REST Framework-based Shareabouts data server, reporting tools, and core parts of the mapping interface.</p>

          <p>In early 2014, we began working on <a href="http://openplans.org/">OpenPlans</a>, an outgrowth of our experience building tools and web sites for urban planning projects. I worked on many parts of this project: server-side data management, external service integration, APIs, browser-side interface development, and testing.</p>

            <h3>Code for America Fellow</h3>
            <p>2011</p>
          </header>

          <p>As one of Code for America's inaugural fellows, I worked with the cities of Philadelphia and Seattle to identify and extend the <a href="http://changeby.us/">Change by Us</a> platform for their needs. As part of that process, I along with my fellowship team helped Local Projects, the original authors of Change by Us, release the project as <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/Change-By-Us">open source</a>.</p>

          <p>I also started the <a href="http://councilmatic.org/">Councilmatic</a> project. I was frustrated at the relative difficulty of accessing legislative data in Philadelphia, so started creating a scraper, and later a website for finding and subscribing to relevant artifacts of city council meetings. This project is open source and has since been adopted in several other US cities.</p>

          <p>Cyborg City was a series of dinner discussions, <a href="https://github.com/mjumbewu/cyborg-city-presentation">evolving presentations</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/mjumbewu/cyborgcity">set of resources</a> built around the practice of looking back over the significant developments in the relationship between people and their environments as mediated by technology, from the perspective of someone 40 years in the future.</p>

          <p>Specifically, I hosted a series of dinners where each was relatively focused around <a href="https://github.com/mjumbewu/cyborgcity/blob/master/DISCUSSION_READING_LIST.md">a topic</a>, and for an hour or two we discussed significant events and developments related to that topic over the last 40 years, as if we were in the year 2056.</p>

          <p>The work spawned talks at DjangoCon US 2016, BarCamp Philly 2016, ORD Camp 2017, and Ignite Philly 19 (March, 2017)</p>
