        <p>I use technology as a tool to help build the capacity of individuals and communities to shape their cities, their neighborhoods, and their own lives.  This perspective of technology as a means for social empowerment guides my professional and "extracurricular" development.</p>
        <p>I primarily work in Web stacks with Python and/or JavaScript at the core. I have experience in several other languages, and am committed to using the best tools in context.</p>

            <h3>Urban Technologist at OpenPlans</h3>
            <p>2012 - Present</p>
          </header>

          <p>I work on a small team with amazing people on projects that empower people to get involved in planning for the future of their communities and cities. Among other projects, we work on the following:</p>

          <p>Since 2012, we have been developing <a href="http://openplans.org/shareabouts/">Shareabouts</a>, a flexible tool for gathering geography-specific public input. I have been primarily responsible for developing the Django REST Framework-based Shareabouts data server, reporting tools, and core parts of the mapping interface.</p>

          <p>In early 2014, we began working on <a href="http://openplans.org/">OpenPlans</a>, an outgrowth of our experience building tools and web sites for urban planning projects. I work on many parts of this project: server-side data management, external service integration, APIs, browser-side interface development, and testing.</p>

            <h3>Code for America Fellow</h3>
            <p>2011</p>
          </header>

          <p>As one of Code for America's inaugural fellows, I worked with the cities of Philadelphia and Seattle to identify and extend the <a href="http://changeby.us/">Change by Us</a> platform for their needs. As part of that process, I along with my fellowship team helped Local Projects, the original authors of Change by Us, release the project as <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/Change-By-Us">open source</a>.</p>

          <p>I also started the <a href="http://councilmatic.org/">Councilmatic</a> project. I was frustrated at the relative difficulty of accessing legislative data in Philadelphia, so started creating a scraper, and later a website for finding and subscribing to relevant artifacts of city council meetings. This project is open source and has since been adopted in several other US cities.</p>
